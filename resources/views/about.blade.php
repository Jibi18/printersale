            E-commerce(Printer Sale) is fast gaining ground as an accepted and used business paradigm. More and more
            business houses are implementing web sites providing functionality for performing commercial
            transactions over the web. It is reasonable to say that the process of shopping on the web is
            becoming commonplace.The objective of this project is to develop a general purpose e-commerce store where product
            like printers can be bought from the comfort of home through the Internet. However, for
            implementation purposes, this paper will deal with an offline shopping for printers.
            An offline store is a store on the Internet where customers can browse the catalog and
            select products of interest. The selected items may be collected in a shopping cart. At checkout
            time, the items in the shopping cart will be presented as an order. At that time, more
            information will be needed to complete the transaction. Usually, the customer will be asked to select
            a payment information as cash on delivery. Finally, the customers are about to book the product as soon as the order
            is placed. The payment deal is done once the customer come to buy the product on the shop. </p>
